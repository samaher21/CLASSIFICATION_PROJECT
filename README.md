# Weather_rain-or-snow


# Background(Question/need):

Using the data provide by kaggle, we are going to build a classification model to predicting the **weather** of a day given several features like **temperature, wind speed, humidity** etc. and the **targeted** classification is two categories of weather they (**rain** and **snow**) of a next day.

# Data Description:

The datase that will be used in this project has been downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package)..The Dataset contains about 10 Years of daily weather, It includes **(96,453)rows** and **(12)features** such as:

-	Formatted Date.

-	Summary.

-	Precip Type.

-	Temperature (C).

-	Apparent Temperature (C).

-	Humidity.

-	Wind Speed (km/h).

-	Wind Bearing (degrees).

-	Visibility (km).

-	Loud Cover.

-	Pressure (millibars).

-	Daily Summary.

# Tool:

**•	Technologies:**
