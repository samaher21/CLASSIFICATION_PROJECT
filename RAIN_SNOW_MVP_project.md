# Weather_rain-or-snow
### Goal of the project:
The core objective of this project is to classify whether will rain or snow based on weather data.

### Workflow:
The dataset for this project is the weather History dataset on Kaggle,
And our target is the **PRECIP TYPE** (rain, snow) column.

1-Dropped all duplicated rows and unneeded columns.

2-Removed nulls and outliers.

3-Converting object-type columns into numeric.

4-find the correlation and plot heatmap

The number of columns and rows before cleaning were **12** and **96,453** After cleaning up the data the number of columns and rows are **16** and **95,829**.

The figure below shows the correlation between the features

### Next step:

Afterwards, We plan to experiment with the Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Support Vector Machines,Decision Tree, KNN and Naive Bayes models.
Currently, weâ€™re in the midst of tuning the logistic regression model to obtain better results.
